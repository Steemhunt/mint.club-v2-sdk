## Introduction

### Neynar

The frame recipes are dependent on [Neynar](https://neynar.com/) to validate frame data.

To use the recipes, you need to have a Neynar account and provide your own Neynar API key.

### Frog.fm

The recipes in this section will be built on top of [frog.fm](https://frog.fm/), a popular framework created by the **wevm** team for building frames on farcaster.

There are multiple platforms you can use, but we'll be using [Bun](https://bun.sh) in the recipe examples.

Check out their [getting started](https://frog.fm/getting-started) section to get a better understanding of how the framework works.
