description: Renounce ownership of the stake contract (permanent action)
---

# renounceOwnership

Renounce ownership of the staking contract, making it permanently ownerless. This is an irreversible action that cannot be undone.

:::danger[Irreversible Action]
Once ownership is renounced, it cannot be restored. The contract will become permanently ownerless and certain administrative functions will no longer be available.
:::

:::warning[Owner Only]
This function can only be called by the current contract owner. Use [`getOwner`](/docs/sdk/stake/getOwner) to check who the current owner is.
:::

## Usage

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { mintclub } from 'mint.club-v2-sdk'

await mintclub.network('base').stake.renounceOwnership({
  onSuccess: (receipt) => {
    console.log('Ownership renounced successfully!', receipt)
  },
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error('Failed to renounce ownership:', error)
  },
})
```

## Return Value

`Promise<TransactionReceipt>`

Returns a promise that resolves to a `TransactionReceipt` object when the transaction is successful.

## Parameters

### onSignatureRequest (optional)

- Type: `onSignatureRequest?: () => void;`
- Default: `undefined`

Callback function for when the user is requested to sign the transaction.

```ts
await mintclub.network('base').stake.renounceOwnership({
  onSignatureRequest: () => {
    console.log('Please sign the transaction')
  }, // [!code focus]
})
```

### onSigned (optional)

- Type: `onSigned?: (txHash: '0x${string}') => void;`
- Default: `undefined`

Callback function for when the user signs the transaction.

```ts
await mintclub.network('base').stake.renounceOwnership({
  onSigned: (txHash) => {
    console.log('Transaction signed:', txHash)
  }, // [!code focus]
})
```

### onSuccess (optional)

- Type: `onSuccess?: (receipt: TransactionReceipt) => void;`
- Default: `undefined`

Callback function for when the transaction is successful.

```ts
await mintclub.network('base').stake.renounceOwnership({
  onSuccess: (receipt) => {
    console.log('Ownership renounced successfully!', receipt)
  }, // [!code focus]
})
```

### onError (optional)

- Type: `onError?: (error: unknown) => void;`
- Default: `undefined`

Callback function for when the transaction fails. This also includes when the user rejects the transaction.

```ts
await mintclub.network('base').stake.renounceOwnership({
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error('Failed to renounce ownership:', error)
  }, // [!code focus]
})
```

## Example

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { mintclub } from 'mint.club-v2-sdk'

const stake = mintclub.network('base').stake

// Check current owner before renouncing
const currentOwner = await stake.getOwner()
console.log('Current owner:', currentOwner)

// ⚠️  CAUTION: This action cannot be undone!
const confirmRenounce = window.confirm(
  'Are you sure you want to renounce ownership? This action is permanent and cannot be undone.',
)

if (confirmRenounce) {
  await stake.renounceOwnership({
    onSuccess: (receipt) => {
      console.log('Ownership has been permanently renounced')
      console.log('The contract is now ownerless')
    },
    onError: (error) => {
      if ((error as Error).message?.includes('OwnableUnauthorizedAccount')) {
        console.error('Only the contract owner can renounce ownership')
      } else {
        console.error('Failed to renounce ownership:', error)
      }
    },
  })
} else {
  console.log('Ownership renouncement cancelled')
}
```

## Important Considerations

### After Renouncing Ownership

Once ownership is renounced, the following functions will no longer be callable:

- [`updateClaimFee`](/docs/sdk/stake/updateClaimFee)
- [`updateCreationFee`](/docs/sdk/stake/updateCreationFee)
- [`updateProtocolBeneficiary`](/docs/sdk/stake/updateProtocolBeneficiary)
- `transferOwnership`

### Recovery

There is **no way** to recover ownership once it has been renounced. Make sure this is what you want to do before proceeding.

### Use Cases

Renouncing ownership might be appropriate when:

- The contract has reached its final, stable state
- No further administrative changes are needed
- You want to ensure the contract remains immutable
