## Usage

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { mintclub } from 'mint.club-v2-sdk'

await mintclub.network('base').stake.transferOwnership({
  newOwner: '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890',
  onSuccess: (receipt) => {
    console.log('Ownership transferred successfully!', receipt)
  },
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error('Failed to transfer ownership:', error)
  },
})
```

  onError: (error) => {
    console.error('Failed to transfer ownership:', error)
  }, // [!code focus]
})
```

## Example

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { mintclub } from 'mint.club-v2-sdk'

const stake = mintclub.network('base').stake

// Check current owner
const currentOwner = await stake.getOwner()
console.log('Current owner:', currentOwner)

// New owner address
const newOwnerAddress = '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890'

// Validate new owner address (basic check)
if (!newOwnerAddress.startsWith('0x') || newOwnerAddress.length !== 42) {
  throw new Error('Invalid Ethereum address format')
}

// Confirm transfer
const confirmTransfer = window.confirm(`Are you sure you want to transfer ownership to ${newOwnerAddress}?`)

if (confirmTransfer) {
  await stake.transferOwnership({
    newOwner: newOwnerAddress,
    onSuccess: (receipt) => {
      console.log('Ownership transferred to:', newOwnerAddress)
      console.log('New owner now has administrative control')
    },
    onError: (error) => {
      if (error.message?.includes('OwnableUnauthorizedAccount')) {
        console.error('Only the contract owner can transfer ownership')
      } else {
        console.error('Failed to transfer ownership:', error)
      }
    },
  })
} else {
  console.log('Ownership transfer cancelled')
}
```

## Administrative Functions Available to New Owner

Once ownership is transferred, the new owner will be able to call:

- [`updateClaimFee`](/docs/sdk/stake/updateClaimFee) - Update the claim fee
- [`updateCreationFee`](/docs/sdk/stake/updateCreationFee) - Update the pool creation fee
- [`updateProtocolBeneficiary`](/docs/sdk/stake/updateProtocolBeneficiary) - Update the protocol beneficiary
- `transferOwnership` - Transfer ownership to another address
- [`renounceOwnership`](/docs/sdk/stake/renounceOwnership) - Permanently renounce ownership

## Important Considerations

### Immediate Transfer

Ownership transfer is immediate and cannot be reversed once the transaction is confirmed.

### Verify New Owner

Make sure the new owner address is correct and that you trust the recipient with administrative control over the contract.

### Multi-signature Wallets

For enhanced security, consider transferring ownership to a multi-signature wallet instead of an individual address.
