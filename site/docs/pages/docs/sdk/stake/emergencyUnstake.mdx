# emergencyUnstake

Emergency unstake all staked tokens from a pool without claiming any rewards. Use this when you need to quickly withdraw your stake.

:::tip[Use Case]
This function is useful when:

- You need to quickly exit a position
- The pool has issues or is compromised
- You want to avoid claiming fees
