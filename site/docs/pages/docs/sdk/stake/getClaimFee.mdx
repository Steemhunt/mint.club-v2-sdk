# getClaimFee

Get the protocol fee percentage charged when claiming rewards from staking pools.

## Usage

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { mintclub } from 'mint.club-v2-sdk'

const claimFee = await mintclub.network('base').stake.getClaimFee()
console.log('Claim fee percentage:', claimFee)
```

## Return Value

`Promise<bigint>`

Returns a promise that resolves to the claim fee percentage. The fee is typically expressed as basis points (e.g., 500 = 5%).

## Example

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { mintclub } from 'mint.club-v2-sdk'

const claimFee = await mintclub.network('base').stake.getClaimFee()

// Convert basis points to percentage
const feePercentage = Number(claimFee) / 100
console.log(`Claim fee: ${feePercentage}%`)

// Calculate expected fee on rewards
const expectedRewards = BigInt('1000000000000000000') // 1 token
const feeAmount = (expectedRewards * claimFee) / BigInt(10000)
console.log('Fee on 1 token reward:', feeAmount)
```
