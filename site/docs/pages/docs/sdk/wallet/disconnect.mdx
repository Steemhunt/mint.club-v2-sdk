# disconnect 

Disconnects the user's wallet from the application.

:::tip[Tip]
It's actually not possible to "disconnect" a user from their wallet programmatically.

To fully disconnect, the user will have to manually disconnect through their wallet.

The SDK shallowly disconnects the wallet from the application and maintains the user's wallet connection status in the `localstorage`. 
:::

## Usage

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { mintclub } from 'mint.club-v2-sdk'
 
await mintclub.wallet.disconnect(); // [!code focus]
```

## Return Value

`void`
