# Getting the most juice out of the SDK 

The Mint Club SDK internally uses the [`viem@2.7.16`](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/public) to make read/write calls. 

This means that you can access both the `public` and `wallet` clients to make read/write calls.

Using Public/Wallet Client opens up a lot of possibilities for you to explore outside of the SDK boxes.

For example

- you can use the `publicClient` to read [`block data`](/docs/sdk/network/getPublicClient#publicclient),
- you can use the `walletClient` to [`sign a message`](/docs/sdk/network/getWalletClient#walletclient)
- and much more.
