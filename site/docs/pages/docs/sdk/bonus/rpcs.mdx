# RPCs

Mint.club SDK uses viem's [`fallback`](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/transports/fallback) to ensure that the read/write calls are made with high availability.

Below are the list of RPCs that are used.

:::success
The SDK pings all the available RPCs and selects the one with the lowest latency. If the selected RPC fails, the SDK will automatically switch to the next available RPC.
