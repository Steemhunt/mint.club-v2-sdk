---

# Getting Started 

Mint.club SDK internally uses [`@filebase/client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@filebase/client) to upload files to IPFS.

:::success[Filebase]
[Filebase](https://filebase.com/) is a free, decentralized storage solution that is used to store the media files of the nft.

It is needed to upload image and metadata to IPFS. You can get your API key for free from [Filebase](https://filebase.com/).

:::warning[Tip]
IPFS functions should be called in the server side so that the API key is not exposed to the client side.

## What is IPFS?

IPFS is a protocol and network designed to create a content-addressable, peer-to-peer method of storing and sharing hypermedia in a distributed file system. IPFS is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data.

## Getting an API Key

To get an API key, you need to sign up on [Filebase](https://filebase.com/) and create a new bucket.
