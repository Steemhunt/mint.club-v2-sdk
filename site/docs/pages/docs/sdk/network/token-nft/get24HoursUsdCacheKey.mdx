# get24HoursUsdCacheKey

Returns a stable cache key based on chain, token address, and a timestamp rounded to the nearest 10 minutes (~24h ago). Use this to decide on the client if a refetch is necessary.

## Usage

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { mintclub } from 'mint.club-v2-sdk'

const { cacheKey, timestamp } = mintclub.network('base').token('GMFR').get24HoursUsdCacheKey()

// Compare cacheKey to your stored key to determine if you should refetch
```

## Return Value

```ts
{
  cacheKey: string
  timestamp: number // unix seconds, rounded to nearest 10 minutes
}
```

## Notes

- Recommended to check this on the client for conditional refetching.
- The key format is `usd-rate-<chainId>-<tokenAddress>-<timestamp>`.
