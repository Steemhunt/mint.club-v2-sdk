## Why is there a creation fee?

:::note[Creation Fees on Mint Club]
A nominal fee, equivalent to $5 in tokens, is required for creating bonding curve-backed tokens or NFT contracts on Mint.club. 

This fee is implemented as a `safeguard against front-runners` who might attempt to steal a chosen token symbol, and to minimize abusive attempts. 
:::

```json
The exact creation fees per chain are as follows

> Ethereum: 0.002 ETH
