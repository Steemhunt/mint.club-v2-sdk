# TransactionReceipt

:::tip[Transaction Receipt]
A `Transaction Receipt` is a record of the result of a specific transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. When a transaction is submitted to the Ethereum network, it is processed by miners and included in a block. Once the block is added to the blockchain, a transaction receipt is generated and stored on the blockchain.

A transaction receipt contains information about the transaction, including:

- The transaction hash: a unique identifier for the transaction.
- The block number and block hash: the block in which the transaction was included.
- The gas used: the amount of gas consumed by the transaction.
- The status of the transaction: "success" if the transaction was executed, otherwise "reverted" if the transaction reverted.
- The logs generated by the transaction: any log events generated by the smart contract during the transaction execution.
