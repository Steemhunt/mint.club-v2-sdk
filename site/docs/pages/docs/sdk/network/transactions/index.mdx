# Transactions [How to sign transactions using the SDK]

## Common use cases

Unlike `read calls`, `write calls` require users to sign transactions.

For example, when a user wants to create a new asset, he/she will need to sign the transaction using a wallet like `Metamask`

:::code-group

```ts [example.ts]
import { curveData } from './data';

await mintclub
  .network('ethereum')
  .token('MINT')
  .create({
    name: 'Mint Club',
    reserveToken: {
      address: '0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2', // mainnet WETH token address 
      decimals: 18, 
    }, 
	curveData, 
	onSignatureRequest: () => {},
	onSigned: (tx) => {},
	onSuccess: (receipt) => {},
	onError: (error ) => {}
  })

// The user will be prompted to sign the transaction
```

```ts [data.ts]
export const curveData = {
	curveType: 'LINEAR', 
	stepCount: 10,
	maxSupply: 10_000,
	initialMintingPrice: 0.01, // 0.01 WETH 
	finalMintingPrice: 0.1, // 0.1 WETH
	creatorAllocation: 100,
}
```

If you're using this SDK in a browser environment where your users will be signing transactions, the SDK will try to use the `window.ethereum` provider by default. 

## Other use cases

However, there are cases where you might want to use a custom provider or use the SDK in a non-browser environment to sign the transaction.

## Beyond Infinity 

### Getting the most juice out of the SDK ðŸ§ƒ

The Mint Club SDK internally uses the [`viem@2.7.16`](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/public) to make read/write calls. 

This means that you can access both the `public` and `wallet` clients to make read/write calls.

Using Public/Wallet Client opens up a lot of possibilities for you to explore outside of the SDK boxes.

For example

- you can use the `publicClient` to read [`block data`](/docs/sdk/network/transactions/getPublicClient#publicclient),
- you can use the `walletClient` to [`sign a message`](/docs/sdk/network/transactions/getWalletClient#walletclient)
- and much more.
