# getPublicClient [Using public client to make read calls]

## PublicClient

Public clients are used to make `read` calls.

You can access the public client for a specific `network` by calling `getPublicClient` on the `network` object.

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { mintclub } from 'mint.club-v2-sdk'

const publicClient = await mintclub.network('base').getPublicClient() // [!code focus]
```

Using this public client, you could make read calls to non-mint.club contracts as well.

:::note[Tip]
The example below retrieves the `block` data from the `base` network.
:::

```ts twoslash [example.ts]

import { mintclub } from 'mint.club-v2-sdk'

const publicClient = await mintclub.network('base').getPublicClient() 

const block = await publicClient.getBlock(); // [!code focus]
// 			^?













```
