## The Problems ‚ùì

::::steps

### Dependence on Exchanges

Tokens typically need to be listed on exchanges for trading. This process can be time-consuming and often requires meeting stringent criteria and paying substantial listing fees.

### Liquidity Issues

For a token to be tradable, it needs liquidity. In traditional markets, liquidity is provided by market makers, who are incentivized to do so by the potential for profit from the spread between the buy and sell prices. However, this model can lead to monopolistic practices and doesn't guarantee constant liquidity.

### Price Slippage

In traditional order book models, large orders can significantly impact the token price, leading to price slippage. This can deter traders from placing large orders and can lead to increased price volatility.

### Centralization

Traditional trading methods often involve centralized exchanges, which are vulnerable to hacks, have control over the funds, and can be influenced by regulatory changes.

### Order Book Maintenance

Maintaining an order book for a token requires significant resources and technical infrastructure, which can be a barrier for new tokens or smaller projects.

## The Solutionüí°

### Bonding Curve Asset Builder with Infinite Flexibility

Mint Club provides a seamless platform for creating bonding curve-backed tokens or NFTs, using any ERC20 token as the base asset in the bonding curve pool. It facilitates easy tokenization with a completely no-code solution, offering highly customizable bonding curve designs, adjustable creator royalties, a variety of creator tools, and a user-friendly interface for trading bonding curve assets.

## Key features üõ†Ô∏è

::::steps

### Bonding Curve Asset Creation (ERC20 or ERC1155)

- Create a bonding curve token (ERC20) or NFT (ERC1155) by using another ERC20 token as the base asset for your token's bonding curve pool.
- Choose from curve types such as linear, exponential, or flat line, and adjust the price variation intervals for your token's journey.
- Set key token specifications like initial minting price, free minting allocation, final minting price, and supply.
  Deploy your asset on various Layer 1 and 2 networks.

### Buy `(Mint)` and Sell `(Burn)` Bonding Curve Asset

- When a bonding curve token is bought, the price curve determines the amount of the base token to be paid, enabling a swap. The paid base tokens are stored in the bonding curve pool, and an equivalent amount of the bonding curve tokens is minted to the buyer.
- Conversely, when a bonding curve token is sold, the curve calculates the amount of base tokens to be returned. These base tokens are then returned to the seller, and the equivalent bonding curve tokens are burned.

### Airdrop Tool

- Set up a public or private airdrop for ERC20 or ERC1155 tokens created on Mint Club V2.
- For private airdrops, Mint Club offers a merkleRoot-based whitelist feature.

### Lock-up Tool

- Create a contract-bound lock-up schedule for ERC20 or ERC1155 tokens created on Mint Club V2.
- Specify the unlock time and recipient address for after the lock-up period is completed.
